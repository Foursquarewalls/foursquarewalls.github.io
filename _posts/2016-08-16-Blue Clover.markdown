# Pattern and fabric

I used the Papercut Clover dress pattern, and cut size xs. The fabic I chose is a deep blue Atelier Brunette viscose with a beautiful drape. I made the contrast v inset using a piece of black linen from my scrap bag.

# The making

This dress came together very quickly, being such a simple pattern, very easy to follow. Because it is such a basic pattern it is very versatile too to modify and play around with (see my later posts).

# Verdict

Overall, I have worn out the 2 original dresses that I made from this pattern. I have made 2 other dresses using different fabric and messed around with some modifications. However, I do think this pattern definitely works best with drapey fabrics, such as viscose.
