# Pattern and fabric

I used the Papercut Clover dress pattern, (a highly recommended pattern) and cut a size xs. The fabic I used was a deep blue Atelier Brunette viscose with a nice drape. The contrast v inset was from a piece of black linen from my scrap bag.

# The making

This dress came together very quickly, being such a simple pattern and very easy to follow. It was completed in a few hours, so a pretty satisfying make. I omitted sewing the tassel belt, instead just wearing it with a normal waisted belt.

# Verdict

Overall I have worn out the 2 original dresses that I made from this pattern. I have made 2 other dresses, modifying the original pattern and using different fabrics (see my later posts). This pattern works best using fabrics with drape, such as viscose.
