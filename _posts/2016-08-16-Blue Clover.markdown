# Pattern and fabric

I used the Papercut Clover dress pattern, cut size xs. The fabic is an Atelier Brunette viscose with a beautiful drape, and I made the contrast inset using a piece of black linen from my scrap bag. 

# The making

This pattern was extremely easy to use and follow. Because it is such a basic pattern it is very versatile too to modify and play around with.
