# Pattern and fabric

I was trawling through patterns and spotted this Vogue dress pattern
The fabric is a purple knit fabric with a small flower bud pattern.

# The making

This was quite an easy make, with a lovely v neck. The only fiddly section was the midriff band, which I handsewed down. Im not sure on the durability of this garment.... whether the fabric will stay together in one piece. We will have to see what it tooks like after it's had a wash.


# Verdict

I enjoyed sewing up this dress. Although I probabaly won't be making version 2 anytime soon. I have a whole heap of woven fabric wanting to be cut into.
